=> first both number are right shifted by 1 until both are equal.
=> regular increase the count {to count how much you shifted}.
=> if(both are equal than you shift the left at left by count.


class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count =0;
        while(left!=right)
        {
            left>>=1;
            right>>=1;
            count++;
        }
        return (left<<count);
        
    }
};
